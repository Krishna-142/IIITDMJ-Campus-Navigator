🌍 IIITDM Jabalpur Campus Navigation Website
📖 Overview

This project is a QR-based campus navigation system for the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design & Manufacturing (IIITDM) Jabalpur.

By scanning a QR code placed around the campus, visitors and students can access a mobile-friendly web application that lists key locations such as:

Academic Blocks 🎓

Hostels 🏢

Library 📚
